#Step 1 

    #TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.

    #TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.

    #TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.

#Step 2

    #TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display.
    #For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
    #So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.

    #TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
    #If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
    #e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].

    #TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".
    #Hint - Don't worry about getting the user to guess the next letter. We'll tackle that in step 3.

#Step 3

    #TODO-1: - Use a while loop to let the user guess again. The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word and 'display' has no more blanks ("_"). Then you can tell the user they've won.

#Step 4

    #TODO-1: - Create a variable called 'lives' to keep track of the number of lives left. 
    #Set 'lives' to equal 6.

    #TODO-2: - If guess is not a letter in the chosen_word,
    #Then reduce 'lives' by 1. 
    #If lives goes down to 0 then the game should stop and it should print "You lose."

    #TODO-3: - print the ASCII art from 'stages' that corresponds to the current number of 'lives' the user has remaining.
